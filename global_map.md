# Welcome to Global Map!

### Hello, what is all this?
_Global Map_ is the newest Influence game mode and also a part of the bigger _Factions Game_ that we've been playing on our [Discord server](<https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/1177313731223486504>) for more than 2 years.

It features a game of politics, roleplay, amazing community, rich lore and 2+ year history that you can also find [here](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#index>).

### How does it work together?
*Factions Game* - part of the game that is played on our discord server.

*Global Map* - a new game mode available in the Beta version of Influence.

Both parts of the game share the same map and the same teams of players (aka 'factions').

Political decisions such as alliances and attacks on other factions are made here on discord, while the actual battles are resolved by playing Influence on the Global Map.

### Is the discord part necessary for participation?
No, but you should give a try for exactly one reason - it's really fun!

Also by joining us there and learning more about our lore you'll uncover a whole new world for yourself.

A world which has it's own economy system, inventories, politics, lore stories and much more!

### Should I care if I only want to play Influence?
Up to you of course.

I may suggest this perspective: you can view faction battles as fairly regular 2-day events that you can use for a change of pace compared to your normal Influence playtime.

Even if you choose to not be active on discord, you can help people here immensely by just dropping some IP on the Global Map.

### Okay, but how do I play exactly?
First of all, join Influence Beta on Google Play. If you're reading this text from withing the game - you're already there!

Then go to the Global Map and pick a team to play for.

We have **2-day** "battles" every **7-10 days**.

During battles you **just play Influence** normally and check back on the Global Map to spend earned IP points.

By being active on discord you can also earn additional points to spend on the Map.

### Where do I start?
Read on to learn the basics of the Global Map and then go back to the game to pick a team.

You can also ask around in [factions chat on Discord](<https://discord.com/channels/562910943848169472/995639554042249246>)!

If you're new Discord ping me (AlexxDev) in any channel saying "I'm broke" and I'll give you some in-game gold and items :)

## Move order

> *Cycle* confusingly can refer to two things: 
> - generally - one full round of all factions' turns. 
> - during a battle - one hour of real-time when the score is measured.

There are currently six factions on the Island:
- [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)
- [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>)
- [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)
- [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)
- [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)
- [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

The move order is determined by a random roll on our discord server at the beginning of each cycle.

There's also one more playable team: [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) to represent team-less people offering their services for gold, but they not do have a land on the map and do not get a turn in the move order.

## Schedule

> *[Eon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/eon.html>)* - a unit of time equal to IRL one day, but flexible for lore purposes.

> *[Key members](<https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_07_key_members>)* - most active members of the faction, who can make decisions on behalf of the faction.

Every faction's turn consists of four phases:

- ### Decision - up to 2 days
  - it may end early when the decision is made; 
  - during this time, the faction needs to **confirm that they’re not skipping their turn**;  
  - if the deadline is missed - it’s an auto-skip, GM passes the turn to the next faction; 
  - this decision is announced at the end of the current eon, after which either the _preparation_ phase starts, or the faction skips their turn;
  - after the decision is made, the faction has until the end of the current eon to change their mind.

- ### Preparation - 3 days
  - this is a mandatory wait period before the attack window opens;
  - during this time, the faction has to choose their attack target and prepare for the battle.

- ### Attack window - up to 3 days
  - it may end early when the attack is initiated;
  - during this time, the faction may start their attack at any minute;
  - this can be done via discord's `/gm_start_attack` command by any key member;
  - a faction can only attack adjacent lands or one land over by the sea;,
  - if the deadline is missed - GM initiates the battle for them with a  disadvantage.

- ### Battle time - 2 days
  - battle ends on timer;
  - during this time, we play a Global Map battle in Influence;
  - it has its own big set of rules, key ones are listed below.

## Preparation actions and units

> [Actions](<https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_14_faction_actions>) - a set of in-lore events that factions can start to _influence_ the game.

> [Map units](<https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_06_map_units>) - various units that can be moved around the map and give bonuses to faction in battle.

These are discord game's features that allow factions to increase their base IP bonus in battles. 

The extra points acquired via these are translated into Global Map bonuses:
- these are shown as "discord-based bonuses" in the Global Map interface;
- they are effective during the whole battle and do not change;
- for example, 30% bonus means all IP spending by that team has a 30% boost in this battle.

Only attacker and defender will get bonuses from these actions, other teams will have to do their surprise interventions in battles without them.

## Key Global Map rules
- a battle lasts **48** full cycles;
- one battle cycle lasts **1h;**
- an attack on a tile lasts **5 cycles**;
- to capture or defend a tile, a team has to win **3 or more cycle** during an attack;
- cooldown for attacking captured tiles again is **5 cycles**;
- you can only attack adjacent or no coastal tiles;
- for coastal tiles, you can attack one _land_ over the sea;
- there's a bonus for attacking early in the cycle;
- attacking late in the cycle is penalized to prevent what's known as "late-sniping";
- adjacent tilese of the same team provide 10% bonus to that team in nearby tile attacks;
- we’re playing in the context of a [bigger map](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#index>), but the “play area” is only one region - this means tiles along the borders with other regions will always be possible to attack by that faction;

> ### Example 1
> - BB attacks CI in Cybertron Jungle;
> - All tiles outside Cybertron Jungle are not attackable and cannot change ownership;
> - Cybertron Jungle tiles along the green border have an outside connection to other CI lands, so CI can always attack them (except cooldown);
> - Cybertron Jungle tiles along the pink border have an outside connection to another BB land, so BB can always attack them (except cooldown).
> - Coastal tiles can be attacked by both factions.
> ![example1](https://zeithalt.github.io/lore/i//global_map_example1.png)

- the battle is in general 1 vs 1 (attacking vs defending faction);
- however, if a faction has an outside connection to the “play area”, they can fight against both the attacker and the defender by declaring war on them during the battle;

> ### Example 2
> - DC attacks PS in Mt. Pickles
> - DC progresses quickly and captures the majority of PS lands;
> - But PS is in a pickle - they have only one tile to counter-attack if they quickly lose it all;
> - In this situation, CI may open a new front against DC by invading Mt. Pickles from the west;
> - CO too can join the battle directly; however, both MT and BB do not have a connection to the “play area” so their only options is supporting others according to global map diplomacy rules.
