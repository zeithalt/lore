### Direct Play

`⚔️ Global Map`

**Direct Play** allows you to score more points in battle by playing Influence games for specific tiles.

You select a tile on the `⚔️ Global Map` and click Direct Play in the bottom panel.

This start a normal Influence match with your default singleplayer settings. 

After you win this match, your scored IP points are automatically applied to the selected tile. 

These same IP points are also counted as usual when you enter the `⚔️ Global Map` next tile - effectively doubling your IP input.
