# Zeithalt Lore Guide

## Introduction

Welcome, interested reader!

You're here either because you got interested in the stories of Zeithalt, or because you're interested in writing your own stories, or you simply got lost.

Either way, this is your chance to learn more about the wonderful world of Zeithalt Island and its lore!

### What is this document?

This is an _optional_ guide for the readers and writers of the Zeithalt stories. It contains general information about the world, its inhabitants, and inner workings of this world.

If you feel like you already have a good grasp of the world, or just feeling intimidated by all this text - don't worry!

You can safely skip this document and still enjoy reading AND writing the stories.

It was compiled by one of the lore writers from all the discussions that happened on our discord server, reviewed and edited by other lore writers, and then approved by the creator of the Factions Game.

The main motivation behind this guide is to provide a consistent and coherent view on the Zeithalt Islands setting, scale, population, battles, and other topics.


### Disclaimer (repeated once more)

First and foremost, this guide is meant to be a _reference_ for the writers of the stories. It is not a rulebook, and it is not a requirement to follow it.

The stories are meant to be fun, and the writers are encouraged to use their creativity and imagination to create the best stories they can.

As already mentioned multiple times, this is an _optional_ guide. You don't need to follow it in writing your stories, and you don't need to read it to enjoy the stories.

I hope that I mentioned it enough times to excuse myself and write the rest of this document in a more direct manner, without reminding you at every possible moment that what you can read here is just... opinions.

And you are, of course, entitled to your own opinions and your own vision.

## Timeline and Time Periods

The time on Zeithalt Island is measured in _eons_.

An eon is a period of time that is as long or as short as the lore writer needs it to be. It is not a fixed period of time, neither it is a consistent measure of time.

There's a curated factual [timeline of the major events](https://zeithalt.github.io/t/) - these things DID happen in the world; they are facts that you can rely on.

As a rule of thumb, most stories happen either in direct relation to these major events, or in the time periods between them.

There's also a generally accepted in-lore reason for such a unique flow of time on Zeithalt - the Timeless Desert. It's a place where the time itself gets twisted and distorted the most, however, it's generally acknowledged that the whole island is affected by this phenomenon.

> ### ðŸª¶ Writing Advice
> If possible, avoid setting in stone the specific time periods between confirmed major events.
>
> Follow the timeline if your story calls for it, but leave room for other writers to reuse the same major events and fit in their stories in the same time periods.
>
> Any events in your lore should not contradict the Timeline and should probably be on a lower level of magnitude than what's mentioned there.

## General Description of the World

Zeithalt Island is a large landmass, with a variety of climates and terrains. There are no other lands or continents known to the inhabitants of Zeithalt Island.

The setting of the world is best described as "augmented medieval."

Most of the island is stuck in some kind of medieval stasis.

People use horses and carriages for transportation, and swords and bows for combat. There are no widespread firearms, although such - and even better - technology does exist in this world (more on in the next section).

As a rule of thumb, the technology level is similar to the late medieval period, with some exceptions made for specific characters and places of the world.

The world is divided into several factions, each with its own unique culture, technology, and way of life.

However, the factions should be seen as more of a ruler class in this world - their members have access to the best technology, magic and power sources, while the common folk is left to fend for themselves.

There are four major factions in the world, here are their names and some general associations:

**Cybernetics Inc (CI)** - a faction deeply invested in futuristic technology, with a focus on cybernetics and robotics. Sometime lore writers add a tinge of a religious following to the "Great AI" when describing this faction.

**MindTech Institute (MT)** - a faction that focuses on the power of the mind and knowledge. Stories about his faction could explore topics of telepathy, telekinesis, and other psychic abilities.

**Delta Collective (DC)** - a faction that uses the power of chaos to achieve their goals. This faction is often associated with dark magic and forbidden knowledge.

**Protectores Silva (PS)** - a faction rooted in the natural world, with a focus on the protection of the environment and the creatures that inhabit it. This faction derives its power from the natural world.

There's also a new fifth faction - **Cloudy Cooperatives** - presumably built on the ideas of capitalism and free market, with a focus on trade and commerce. However, given the new status of this faction, their lore is much less developed than the other four.

All factions, however, exert the same amount of power and influence over the world, there are no inherently stronger or weaker, good or bad factions (although each writer usually adopts the perspective of their own faction).

There's a separate [section on factions](reference_needed) in this guide, so we won't go into too much detail here.

> ### ðŸª¶ Writing Advice
> Only a small portion of the population is actually a part of any faction.
>
> With a very loose interpretation of the word "elite," the factions are the "elites" of the world, and they rule over the common folk.
>
> Avoid labelling the factions as _objectively_ "good" or "bad" - instead focus on _opinions_ of specific characters, or _views_ of specific factions.

## Magic and Technology

These terms here are often used interchangeably, and also hey are often referred to just as "powers."

Although the factions are often associated with a specific type of power, the powers are not exclusive to the factions. There's no rule that any given character can't have access to more than one type of power.

And even though these powers come from vastly different sources, for the consistency of the world-building they have to be equal in their strength and accessibility.

The powers in this world are not distributed equally, and for the purpose of lore writing, it's safe to assume that population centers of specific factions are the places where the powers are most abundant and accessible.

To give a couple examples:

- In Admincity (of CI), the technology is probably abundant and access to the city-wide-web is universal. It's recommended to imagine this city like a cyberpunk megapolis.

- In Neuropolis (of MT), most of the population in one way or another related to the Institute, highly educated and skilled in such powers of mind as light forms of telepathy.

And so on for other factions and their respective "sources of power." The powers are usually concentrated in the capitals of the factions, and as we go further away, these concentrations of power become fewer and smaller.

The existence of magic and tech in this world is not a secret, and it's not something hidden from the common folk. However, this begs a very valid question - _why then the rest of the Island is stuck in the medieval state?_

Consider the possible answers to this question:

- The resources are scarce. For example, the full-scale world-wide production of computer tech might not be possible due to limited resources and absence of production facilities.

- The magic requires great skill and knowledge to use, and the common folk simply does not have access to the necessary teaching resources, they have to feed themselves and their families.

- The island is constantly affected by the corruption that occasionally outbursts in large swats of lands, undoing the progress made there and sucking in resources for containment and restoration.

- The effect that the Timeless Desert has on the whole island may play a part in this too.

When assessing the limits of power, it's important to remember that the CR artifacts have to be the strongest on the island. They are nowhere near powerful enough to obliterate an army, but significant enough to be a big deal when used.

> ### ðŸª¶ Writing Advice
> When writing about the specific skills or tech used by faction members, keep your descriptions direct and to the point of the specific situation.
>
> But at the same time be purposefully vague when describing the powers and origins of powers as a whole, to give other writers the freedom to explore and expand on the world.
>
> Avoid setting narrow world-wide precedents and unnecessary constraints.
>
>  If you need to introduce a new powerful device or weapon that is stronger than CR artifacts - *think twice or thrice about it*.
